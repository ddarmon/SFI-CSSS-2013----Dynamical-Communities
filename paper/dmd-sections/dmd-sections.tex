\section{Network and Dynamics}

Before proceeding, we fix some notation, following \cite{kolaczyk2009statistical}. Let $G = (V, E)$ be the graph that represents the $|V|$ vertices in the network and the $|E|$ edges between them. We will consider a random field evolving in time on this network. That is, for a finite network, let $X(t, v)$ denote the random variable in some countable alphabet $\mathcal{X}_{v}$ associated with vertex $v$ at time $t$. Overall, $X(t, v)$ is a time-varying random field whose dynamics take place on $G$ and are effected by the topology of $G$. Thus, for fixed $t$, $X(t, \cdot)$ is a random vector and for fixed $v$, $X(\cdot, v)$ is a random field.

For the particular problem we consider here, 

\section{Edge Weighting using Dynamics}

\cite{shalizi2007discovering}

\begin{align}
	I^{*}[X^{u}; X^{v}] = \frac{I[X^{u}; X^{v}]}{\min \{ H[X^{u}], H[X^{v}]\}}
\end{align}

Lorem ipsum. \cite{ver2012information}

\begin{align}
	P(X(t, v) = 1 | \mathbf{X}(t-1), \mathbf{X}(t-2), \ldots) &= P(X(t,v) = 1 | \{ X(t-1, u) : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})\\
	&=\min \left\{p_{v} + \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \iota_{uv} 1[X(t-1, u) = 1], 1\right\}
\end{align}
