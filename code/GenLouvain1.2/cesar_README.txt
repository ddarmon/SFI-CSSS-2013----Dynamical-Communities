This is the matlab released code that I used for the modularity time snapshots. It can be download from:

* http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain

The code can be used not only for modularity across time snapshots or multiplex networks, but also to calculate the modularity in static networks. It is based in the Louvain algorithm (the one used in Gephi) and therefore must give the same results than Gephi when only one snapshot is used.
For more information about the complete algorithm you can check this paper:
