README - GENLOUVAIN VERSION 1.2
released July 2012

Please cite this code as
    Inderjit S. Jutla, Lucas G. S. Jeub, and Peter J. Mucha,    
    "A generalized Louvain method for community detection implemented
    in MATLAB," http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain (2011-2012).

This package consists of two main .m files
    genlouvain.m (a standalone no-mex function file)
    genlouvainmex.m (a version using compiled mex files for some tasks)
and a private directory with associated subroutines and mex files for
the latter code. 

The mex version is particularly more efficient for large, multislice
problems, because the associated modularity/quality matrix B is very
sparse. In contrast, the no-mex version can be more efficient in
settings where the B matrix is dense (even for large, sparse A) so you
are encouraged to try both codes even if you have the mex version
working on your system. Indeed, in some cases we observed the fastest
results from a hybrid version with the "modchange" step performed as
in the no-mex version while keeping the mex version of "tidyconfig";
but this was at best a marginal speedup so this hybrid option is not
included here, for simplicity.

If the mex executables for your system are not in the private
directory, you will need to compile these files on your system (check
the mex documentation in your MATLAB). If you would like to share
these compiled files with other users, email them to Peter Mucha
(mucha@unc.edu).
